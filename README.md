In order to refactor the code i found several areas in the css code that could be edited to make it more efficient. Some of the additions/changes are:

1. One font family for the whole webpage - This makes the page more cohesive for the user
2. add alt to all imgs - Added alt descritpions to all images on the webpage
3. Cleaned up unused ID selectors
4. Ordered the CSS code to be reflect the order of the semantics in the HTML document
5. Refactored a series of CSS code to create less overlap in element selectors
6. Added comments to HTML and CSS code to illustrate purpose of each section
7. Added psuedo class selector to the navigation bar to show user which selection they were hovering above
8. Fixed position of the navigation bar so that it remains when the user scrolls
